# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers likely to leave a service or subscription and take proactive measures to retain them.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment-ready code

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Thomas7689/MLG382-Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MLG382-Customer-Churn-Prediction
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data/` folder.
2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train_models.py
    ```
3. Train the accuracy:
    ```bash
    python train_accuracy.py
    ```
